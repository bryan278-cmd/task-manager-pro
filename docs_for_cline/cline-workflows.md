# Cline Workflows â€” Task Manager Pro

## Workflow: Feature Implementation
1) PLAN
   - Read `docs_for_cline/*`, the target files, and `pages/index.js`.
   - Write a step-by-step plan (max 5 steps), list files to change, and show a minimal diff preview.
2) BRANCH
   - Create a feature branch: `feat/<name>`.
3) APPLY
   - Implement only the approved diff. Keep changes scoped.
4) TEST
   - Ensure `npm run dev` compiles; no hydration warnings; basic manual test path.
5) COMMIT & PR
   - Commit with a conventional message.
   - Push and open a PR with a bullet summary (what/why/testing).
